# ðŸ“ˆ Grafana in Amazon EKS

## ðŸ”¹ What is Grafana?
Grafana is an **open-source visualization and analytics platform**.  
It takes raw metrics (from Prometheus or other data sources) and turns them into **beautiful dashboards, charts, and alerts**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why Grafana in EKS?
When running workloads in **Amazon EKS**, monitoring data can get overwhelming.  
Grafana helps by:  
- Connecting to **Prometheus** (and other sources like CloudWatch, Loki, InfluxDB, etc.).  
- Providing **dashboards** to visualize metrics (CPU, memory, pods, nodes, services).  
- Allowing **custom queries** with PromQL (Prometheus Query Language).  
- Sending **alerts/notifications** (Slack, email, PagerDuty, etc.) when something goes wrong.

## ðŸ”¹ Grafana Workflow in EKS

```text
   +------------------------+
   |     Prometheus         |
   |  Collects Metrics from |
   |  EKS Pods & Services   |
   +-----------+------------+
               |
               | Metrics (Time-Series Data)

## ðŸ”¹ Key Points

* Grafana itself **does not collect metrics** â†’ it only **visualizes** them.
* It connects to Prometheus as a **data source** inside your EKS cluster.
* You can build **real-time dashboards** to monitor:

  * Cluster health
  * Pod performance
  * Resource usage (CPU, memory, network)
  * Application response times

---

## âœ… Summary

Grafana = **eyes of your EKS monitoring system**.
It turns Prometheus data into **actionable insights** through dashboards and alerts.
